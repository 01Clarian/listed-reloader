  ## Listed Productions


  Listed is a SF based initiative that showcases cutting-edge EDM and strives to
  make it accessible via event productions and an artist agency. Our mission is
  to create unforgettable experiences with a warm, intimate vibe for our guests.
  We strive to make the partygoer as important as the headliner because we think
  the experience matters!


  We add personal touches to foster “ridiculous fun for ridiculous people”
  creating a communal atmosphere that’s long been forgotten in the dance music
  scene. listed also acts as an agency of representation for 17 artists from
  around the world. Get listed and join in on our fun!

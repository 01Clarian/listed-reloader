Clarian was born in an ice cube made out of fireballs in the north star. He travelled the universe for 10 billion miles before he decided to take a break. 



That was when he took a vacation in the Bahamas with a kitten named Gork. Gork the kitten had a lot of friends and took Clarian to a cool museum of historical signficance. 



The end.

Clarian is a contrarian and a surrealist weirdo, a science fiction purist and contributor, mixing and mastering electronic engineer, and dj / live performer with a unique indefinable energy. He goes his own way whether dark storms, abandoned warehouses, or misanthropic dive bars. His strange and distinguishable melodic and surreal touches has extended to a wide creatively vibrant dance labels from the very beginnings of Visionquest (Detroit) Life n Death (Italy) Rumors (Ibiza) FOF (Montreal) to engineering and contributions for such mainstays as Ninja Tunes via. Counter, Kompakt, and Turbo. He has collaborated records with Tiga, Felix Da Housecat, Jamie Principle, Guy Gerber, Henry Saiz and Guy J. In his free time he plays chess and collects interesting ornaments.

Cited as a producer’s producer, Clarian has contributed on wide reaching platforms in communities globally. From the volcanic emergence of Detroit’s Visionquest, to the surgical and darker spectrums of Life and Death. Clarian’s distinctive influence shines through with versatility both as a musician and songwriter without being pigeonholed. With contributions ranging from the deeper hues of Ibiza’s Rumours showcased by his “Fear And Self Loathing EP” to creative techno fixtures such as Kompakt and Turbo Recordings are all testaments to Clarian’s reach for his signature sound. Clarian’s longstanding work and in-depth experience as a mixing and mastering engineer in sought-after studios has furthered his own quiet evolution to the craft.



A lifelong fan of author’s such as John Brunner and Phillp K Dick, Clarian’s fascination with Science Fiction and its relationship to electronic music has partially inspired his pursuit into sound production. Introduced to rave electro culture in the late 90s of Montreal by a weirdo crew of degenerate savants, Clarian quickly found himself immersed and compelled with such music pioneers as Kraftwerk and the outlasting legacy of such labels as Daniel Miller’s Mute Record. An addiction to synthesizers and drum machine shortly thereafter developed. This addiction extended to explorations into atmospheric tonalities from Sci- Fi movie scores and cosmic composers such as Bernard Fevre and Vangelis. These influences resonate overtly with open nods on his debut ambient based synth pop album, “Television Days” released on Balance in 2018. Clarian’s discography delves between techno and synth pop fused techno crossovers with numerous legendary collaborations. Collaborations include visionaries such as Tiga with his extensive coproduction and mixing on Tiga’s “No Fantasy Required” LP for Ninja Tune’s Counter Records among others. Browsing through Clarian’s past work in Footprintz and mentorship from Ewan Pearson to his more recent ambient/techno based Eps on Kompakt such as his well received “Ankh” EP in 2017, further underlines this singular yet rare versatility and passion for finding a balance between progressive, synth hooks, and minimalism.



Clarian’s live sets are often unforgettably emotive and synonymous with sunsets and late night melodic peaks. Illustrated at Burning Man in 2018, Clarian performed an album of exclusively crafted and composed spaghetti western inspired electronic music live with a backing band. The band lineup included Who Made Who on guitar and drums as well as an electric violinist performed live on Robot Heart during the Man Burn yielding an ethereal and cathartic experience. Clarian has toured extensively both live and DJ for over a decade festivals and club circuits from Europe and Asia throughout the USA and South America with returning showcases in DEMF, ADE, Off Sonar Piknique Electronique, WMC and BPM to name a few.

Clarian has produced and collaborated with forward thinking artists and labels over the years in a quietly quilted and dependable tone while establishing his very own musical universe resonating at its own frequency of spacey worlds, left-turns, and interconnected pools of electronic of bliss, melancholy or inner dystopian atmospheres. Clarian’s music catalog is an impressive and expanding universe leaving a unique trace for listeners and clubbers to freely follow and explore without the need to continuously label it.
